Farmer Portal

PROPOSAL:
A portal designed to cater to every need of farmers. As the portal is designed for the farmers, it will have a more visual User Interface than a textual one. It will be easy to use and navigate through and will be designed keeping in mind the convenience of the end user of the portal.
The portal will have various sections including a forum for farmers to discuss agricultural problems with other farmers and agricultural experts. This forum can also be used to connect students from agricultural schools to the farmers to discuss real time issues and find efficient solutions. The website will also provide contact details for the kisan call center etc. thus facilitating agri-advisory services.
There will also be a section that will inform farmers about the latest agricultural schemes by the government. The farmers can also view the statistics and news about other farmers thus helping them to figure out the best possible agricultural scheme for themselves. This will form an efficient agri-information dissemination system.
The portal will have a section that will predict the Minimum Support Price for the given crops using previous years data and current trends. One of the goals of this project is to use data mining techniques to find a more efficient and improved MSP calculation system. Another goal of this project is to integrate a chatbot into the portal so as to provide immediate assistance to the farmers. 

Technologies used: 
1. Web technologies for creating the web portal. 
2. Machine learning and data mining for predicting minimum support price. 
3. Sql database and a Nosql database (mongodb) for data assimilation.
